# Kotlin-Sandbox
Kotlin sandbox for core fundementals of the language
Kotlin - named after the Kotlin Island in Russia - is a general purpose statically typed language 
that has become extremely popular in the last few years, designed quite simply as a better alternative 
to java like java it compiles to bytecode that runs on the java virtual machine but kotlin provides a 
more concise syntax and language features.
 
kotlin can be used on both the client and the server,  which means the code can
be run either on the frontend side or on the backend side in the cloud somewehere on a server which 
receives requests from the client and sends the responses back to the client.

Out of 7.3 billion smartphones world wide, kotlin now is widely used for android development 
to write apps for the 2.5 billion devices running the android operating system.

Kotlin has been created in 2011 by JetBrains company, which is very well known for its IDEs
such as IntelliJ, Pycharm and Datagrip; and the first stable release was in 2016; and in 2019 Google 
has named Kotlin The Preferred Language for Android Development over Java.

kotlin is an example of a programming language that allows us to communicate with computers
And as you know, Computers only understand binary zeros and ones, so over the years we've created many
programming languages such as c , Basic, C#, Python, Julia, Scala, Rust, Go, java or javascript just
to name a few, and since kotlin was created much more recently it has taken the lessons from
the earlier languages to make something that is both powerful and easy to use 
To write Kotlin code, I am going to use intellij which you can download for free

I hope this beginner friendly tutorial will be helpful
